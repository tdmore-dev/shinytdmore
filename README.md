# This project
`tdm.ui` provides a series of UI elements to easily build dose adaptation software.

The project focuses on four things:

1. Flexible input elements to easily define the patient covariates, treatment history and observations.
2. Clear graphs to show the input, a priori parameter distributions, the estimation result, and future predicted concentrations vs target.
3. Clear graphs to show the dose search space, the evaluation criteria and the selected dose.
4. Reporting elements to show the recommended dose and what will happen if we apply this dose.
